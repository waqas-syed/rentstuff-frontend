                                    If you already haven't got the idea of Zarqoon.com, it's simply this; connect people willing to get a place on rent
                                    with the people that want to offer their property for rent. And do it without the restriction of living in major
                                    cities, and, without the restriction of only 'per month' rent basis, ability to offer shared properties, letting know while posting what are the additional features and restrictions related to the property on rent.
                                    Hence, Zarqoon.com allows posting of houses, apartments, hostel, hotel and guest rooms, anywhere in Pakistan, allows posting properties on a per hour, per day, per week or a per month basis, supports posting of shared properties and provides functionality to list additional features(WiFi, Garage etc) and restrictions(Girls only, no smoking etc). Thus, providing a platform to do all of this at once. And everything is FREE! No charges at all.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    Thus Zarqoon.com is a specialized rental app for real estate, offering rental estates to be posted for any time frame, allowing shared properties and enabling posting in any part available on Google maps. Yes, our search functionality is powered by Google and any place you can find on Google Maps, you can find it on Zarqoon.com too. So there is no limitation that your property needs to be present in any of the major cities like, Islamabad, Rawalpindi, Lahore or Karachi, we offer these cities plus every other city and town in Pakistan, whether it is the Chitral mountains or Cholistan desert.

                                    Now where did this idea orginated from? There are 2 reasons behind that. Let's start with the first.
                                    <br/>
                                    Our founder lived in a locality where recently there were a lot of large houses built for the purpose of offering them on rent to other residents. Having those large was one task that required significant hard-work and investment, but the next was to find suitable paying guests looking for houses on rent. The property owners see a hard time when they want residents and the people looking to rent a house have no suitable platform to look for such real estate. The only solution to this is to listen to the word of mouth, contact a lot of people and ask them explicitly, and if you hear about such real estate, you go to that place and knock on door-to-door asking for the property you are looking for.
                                    Our founder then had the idea of such a specialized platform where real estate owners could post their houses and apartments for rent in a certain area. The house can be of any size, whether a 5 marla house or a 5 kanal house. Next the people in need for the property can see that easily simply by going online, and check out the houses on rent and their details, compare them with other properties and choose the one that best fits their needs. Contact details and the place will be mentioned too so it is easy to comunicate with the real estate owner. So both the rental house owner and the paying guest have a place to go to to save their time and evergy. What makes Zarqoon.com special than the competition is that Zarqoon employs Google Maps technology to support all the places in Pakistan like mentioned above. Posting a house for rent in Islamabad or Lahore is possible just like posting a house for rent in Hunza or Gawadar. Search for a house or apartment in Bahria Town or DHA is the same as searching in a rural area. And not only houses, but hostel rooms, apartments, hotel rooms and guest house rooms, all share the same functionality. That is the first problem that we intended to solve.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    The second idea: like most people, our founder had a lot of friends in university that were staying in hostels. And he heard his friends - whether they needed a single room in a hostel or multiple rooms if there was a bulk of friends together - talk a lot about finding a hostel, and then the expectations not fulfilled while staying in a said hostel and then they had to shift from one hostel to another, taking chances to find the right one. Those discussions seeded a plant which later got merged in the Zarqoon.com's main idea for houses on rent. A quick research also reveals that there is a huge demand for hostels these days, espacially in cities like Karachi, Lahore, Islamabad and Rawalpindi, as more and more people have to flock to these big cities for higher education or jobs, and they have to find accomodation in a hostel. And the demand is for both girls hostels and boys hostels. Private hostel owners also need a sepcialized channel to promote their hostels, show case the additional features of their hostel and also any restrictions if present, so that they don't have to demo every potential customer about their hostel but instead that information is already displayed on a platform that students, workers and backpackers can visit and see. That was the second idea behind Zarqoon.com: to offer accomodation in hostels for students and the working class, so they are able to search and find the right hostels, compare them and choose the one they think is better than the others.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-4 col-lg-4 alignright">
                                    <img class="alignright" src="https://storage.googleapis.com/rentstuff-1022-photo-storage-bucket/Company_Images/blog_posts/blog-post-1/blog-post-1-hostel.jpg" alt="hostels and hostel rooms in Islamabad, Lahore, Karachi, Rawalpindi or anywhere in Pakistan" width="371" height="249">
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    The third idea: while on vacations, the booking of hotels is a concern. In major cities or tourist destinations, there are a lot of platforms listing hotels and the ability to book them, but in remote areas the offers are scarce. Why not we be able to support all the areas? Such hotels and guest houses can be better compared before going to those areas in the 'vacation planning phase' from the comfort of your home, so you can better arrange for your vacation.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    Additionally, in such tourist spots, there are a lot of local people who are willing to give their house on rent, or a single room for rent. Why not give those people a platform, so not only they can earn some money but the tourist will also be able to find a place to stay at a cheaper cost than most hotels.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    This concludes the third idea. And thus sums up the approach and vision behind Zarqoon.com.
                                </p>

                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    Our vision is to make the process of giving and finding property on rent really simple, fun and time-saving. We want to empower people located anywhere in Pakistan to have something they can count on when renting real estate. And to give them more options than any other platform can, to better convey their expectations. And we tried to designed our app in such a way that it is easy and simple to use yet is detailed and comprehensive.
