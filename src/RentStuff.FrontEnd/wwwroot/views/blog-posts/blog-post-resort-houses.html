                                    Asad lived in Murree, having an entrepreneurial mind but low on resources, young and novice just started stepping into practical life and trying to make a living for himself. His father though left him an asset; a small home on the outskirts of Kashmir Point. As Asad had a couple of rooms in the house to spare, he decided to give those rooms on rent to the tourists that came up to visit the hill station.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    The idea was good. Although, the way he searched for potential customers was manually going to each one; while they were stuck in the traffic as normally happens in Murree, or reaching up to walking tourists and offered them his house for rent on much cheaper terms than the local hotels. Though a tedious procedure, it worked out well for him. And Asad started to make a decent living.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    While going at it, Asad was thinking about more ideas for doing other small businesses, but him giving out his house or room for rent to tourists by reaching out to them personally took a lot of his time and he wasn't able to turn to another venture at the same time. Around those moments, he heard about some flourishing internet companies that were allowing people to give out their homes for rent by posting on the internet. He visited those sites, but he soon realized some loopholes which made him realize that these sites are not going to help him the way he wanted. Reason: 1) These sites didn't have a dynamic search feature which would allow his rural site to be properly enlisted and searchable as those sites were only offering major cities. 2) He gave his rooms on a per hour or a per day basis for rent. Again, this was not featured on those sites, as they dealt with monthly prices. 3) No mention to sharing of the space between multiple tenants at the same time.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    All of the above features could be inserted into the description of the posting, but that is not the point is it. People should be able to compare neatly given statistics in a list of several postings and choose. But Asad had no choice at this time. He did post it on these sites, while injecting and pushing all of these requirements into the description of the posting. He knew that it is hard for people to read all the description and then decide whether they want to take the house on rent or not, but he had not choice.

                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    One day, while surfing the internet, he stumbled across a website, Zarqoon.com. The site was specifically tailored for rental homes, apartments, hostels, hotels and guest houses and thus provided a targetd user interface for people trying to rent out their property. The things of most interest to him were the ability to post at any place; every place available on Google Maps was available on this site with it's Google Maps like search, the ability to post a property on a per hour, per day, per week or per month, and the ability to explicitly mention that this property is sharable between multiple tenants.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    To his delight, he posted his house for rent on Zarqoon.com, and was glad to see that this site allowed him to post and expose his house as he wanted; a small houose on a tourist spot, able to be rented out for a short period, able to come up in Google Maps like searches, when a user would search Murree and it's localities, his house was a must to show up in that list.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    Based on his posting, he was soon contacted over the phone by people coming to Murree and looking for a place to stay, which was cozy and cheaper than the hotels nearby. When tourists stayed in his place, they mentioned how they searched for houses or rooms for rent in Murree on Zarqoon.com using the search feature, and how easy it is to compare different properties through the list. While other sites show places at random positions, Zarqoon.com starts from the properties available nearest to the search location and around it in a sortable fashion.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    The incident mentioned above is one of the reasons we came up with the idea for Zarqoon.com. People with small houses, or even a single room for rent should be able to post their properties online, especially in tourist areas. Such tourist areas are not available on any other sites as these are outside the major cities that they are supporting. Zarqoon.com allows the ability to post your place anywhere in Pakistan, of any size or magnitude, sharable or not, on a daily, monthly or even hourly basis, thus providing the flexibility to bridge between paying guests and property owners.
