                                    Once every summer in Pakistan, when the sun is scorching down on most of the areas in Pakistan, the northern areas are a place to turn to during that season. Northern areas in general and Murree in particular is a home to tens of thousands of tourist especially on Eid days, when around 42,000 vehicles were recorded entering the small hill station on a single day on Eid, while it has space to accomodate only 500 vehicles.

                                    Given that amount of tourist attraction, there are a large number of hotels in the region. Which are enough for a fair amount of peoplee, but still insufficient for the number of people mentioned above. In the summer season, beacause of such high demand for accomodation, the hotel room prices go sky high(of-course), if you are lucky enough to even find a room, as usually on such occasions, all hotel rooms are booked and some people who have not arranged for accomodation before arriving, face some serious problems if they want are planning to stay for a night or two.

                                    The people behind Zarqoon.com got one aspiration from this situation, why not give the people who have houses in such locations and got rooms to spare a chance, to give their house or room for rent to the tourists. And even better, they will offer them for prices lower than the hotels. Zarqoon.com hence provides the ability to put up your house or room for rent on an hourly or daily basis, so people travelling to such places could find a decent and affordable place to stay for the night.

                                    One such story revolves around Jahangir. A marketing manager for an insurance firm in Lahore, who had panned to go to Murree in the month oj July. When setting out on the journey, Jahangir had not idea about making arrangements ahead of time as he thought how much people could possibly be there around that time, and it wouldn't be something to worry about. Little did he know. After the exciting trip with his wife and kids, he reached Murree. The excitement then turn to some amount of worry when he saw long lines of cars from a long way to Mall road still to go. After the agony of waiting for over an hour, they finally reached near Mall Road and parked their car. The enxt immediate thing was for him to book a hotel room as soon as possible. But he realized at that moment, that there were no rooms left to book, as he went from one hotel to another, spending the time for recreation in searching for accommodation. But unfortunately, there was no place to stay.

                                    At that point while he was asking for locals for a place, one of the lads suggested him to visit Zarqoon.com, a place where the locals put on their house or room for rent. Instantly, he was on his mobile's browser typing Zarqoon.com in the address bar. The site came up, he started typing Murree in the search bar of Zarqoon.com and instantly it showed him the list of suggesstions just like in Google Maps. He tapped search, and instantly came up with a list of portions of houses or rooms for rent located nearby and the prices were much less than the hotels he got to visit. He called one of them, asked to meet in a place nearby, met with the owner and went with him right to his house. It was an ordinary house with it's room that opened up to the balcony though, but to Jahangir it was the best accommodation on the world at that time, as he was worried sick where he and his family will go and spend the night with the roads going out of Murree got blocked due to heavy traffic. But nontheless, him and his family now had a place to stay.

                                    That is one of the visions of Zarqoon.com, providing a place to stay anywhere in Pakistan, for any amount of time, and the ability to search and compare in the exact town or spot where you want the accomodation. And a clean, mobile friendly user interface to do so. Finding a room, villa, apartment or house for rent should be as easy as a coupe of clicks and a call.
