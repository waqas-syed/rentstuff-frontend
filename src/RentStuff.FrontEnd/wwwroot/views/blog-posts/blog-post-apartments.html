                                    Right from the start, we tailored Zarqoon.com for a specific domain; the renting out of properties, such as houses, apartments, hostel, hotels and guest houses. Regarding rentals, the concept of apartments is what is most relevant to being provided on rent for a long term. Normally when you rent out a space for the long term, what you will get is an empty space without any furniture or equipment. You will have to hit the market yourself to get all the stuff you need and renovate your apartment yourself.
                                </p>

                                    But nowadays, it is becoming normal to provide furnished apartments for rent, where the only thing you have to do is pay more and you get a fully renovated apartment. Zarqoon.com put emphasis on being able to compare different apartments by providing details about each property in a visual separation that is easy to comprehend. For example, when you look for apartment for rent and click on search, the next page that shows up with the results shows the number of bedrooms, bathrooms and kitchens, along with the size of the apartment, the location, a default picture, whether the apartment is being shared, whether it is for boys only, girls only, families only or open for everyone, and most importantly, the rent price, that could be on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis.
                                </p>
                                <p class="col-md-7 col-lg-7 alignleft">
                                    We tried our best to provide a visual representation for apartments and flats on rent to be as much visually comprehensive, easy and neat to understand as possible. The different elements that describe this information contain visual representations such as the restriction of gender to which that property will be provided, whether it is sharable by multiple tenants, bedrooms, bathrooms etc. We understand the importance of visual representations and that everyone has limited time, so we tried to design an interface using which information can be conveyed as quickly as possible.
